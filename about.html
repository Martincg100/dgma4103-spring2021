    <h3><u>About me.</u></h3>



      <hr>
<p> I am in DMA and I love to paint, these 12 images are what I had done during the time of covid. I was trying, like most people, to keep myself busy. I am a pretty simple person, I love to eat and sleep, so this was the perfect time to do just that! I also got to spend time with my dog whose name is Bella and my niece named serenity.</p>

<p> I hope you enjoy a snippet of my life!</P>
